# Correlation-Visualizer
A Jupyter Notebook that generates two correlated variables and shows charts of them. This is intended to help students understand the concept of correlation.
The charts (a line chart and a scatter chart) are updated when the user changes the correlation coefficient using a Jupyter Widget.
