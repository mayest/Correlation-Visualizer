# Correlation-Visualizer
A Jupyter Notebook that generates two correlated variables and shows charts of them. This is intended to help students understand the concept of correlation.
The charts (a line chart and a scatter chart) are updated when the user changes the correlation coefficient using a Jupyter Widget.

<!--
Alternatively, you can open the notebook in Google Colab, but this is not recommended as the Jupyter widgets do not work in Colab:
